## Install ðŸ˜‡

If you trust me you can run the following command to install the program.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xleft/violence/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```

If you don't then you need to build the program yourself.

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xleft/violence.git
cd violence
cat build.sh
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh <platform> # currently supported: win_64, linux
# move the binary to /usr/local/bin or to your PATH
# Enjoy :)
```

### Run

You can run the program in two modes: file and interactive.

#### Modes:
1. File

```bash
violence <file>
```

2. Interactive

```bash
violence
```
